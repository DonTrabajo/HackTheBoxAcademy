# Hack The Box Academy – Don Trabajo's Notes 🧠💻

Welcome to my evolving field manual for navigating **Hack The Box Academy**.
This repo is a curated archive of my hands-on learning journey through the HTB Academy platform as I sharpen my offensive cybersecurity skills.

Each module is broken down with:

* ✅ Step-by-step walkthroughs
* 🔧 Commands used in real labs
* 🚩 Flag locations (withheld out of respect for HTB rules)
* 💡 Notes, reflections, and tips to reinforce learning
* 📁 Organized by Tier and Difficulty
